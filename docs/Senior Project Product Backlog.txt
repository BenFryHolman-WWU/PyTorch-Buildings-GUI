GUI/Canvas Setup
* Import building components and control policies from the neuromancer library
* Implement interface navigation like pan, zoom, etc.


Drag and Drop Component System
* Implement component selection with some UI so we can see all the options at any given time.
* Implement the ability for components to be dragged onto the canvas.
* Create new instances of a component that appears any time it is dropped onto the canvas.
* Allow moving and deleting of components that already exist.


Component Editing
* Implement ability view and edit each component's properties so they can configure behavior including:
   * Physical parameters such as dimensions.
   * Any potential HVAC settings.
   * Environmental assumptions.
* Include validation that each new property that is edited is allowable given the circumstances.
* Add error messages that are readable in the GUI.


Simulation and Visualizations
* Configure PyTorch building.
* Implement execution of built simulations of building physics.
* Implement closed-loop simulations through control policies.
* Implement plotting and graphing representing the outcome of a simulation showing:
   * Energy consumption
   * Temperature
   * HVAC behavior
* Implement exportation of simulation results and model saving/loading.


Control Policy
* Implement selection of optimization objectives such as energy, comfort, cost, etc.
* Create monitors for training progress through visual feedback.
* Implement storage of trained policies between sessions.


Sprint 0:
1. Setup GitHub
2. Connect the neuromancer package and any dependencies for Neuromancer (torch, torchdiffeq, numpy, matplotlib)
